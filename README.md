# Elm Application Boilerplate

Standard boilerplate for an Elm application with `Browser.application`.

Boostrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
Refer to its documentation if you need to use any of its features. Alternatively, just substitute in your custom build toolchain.

## Set up

Run `npm install` to install the create-elm-app binary and start the dev server with `npm start`.

## Considerations

I've removed the service worker code included with create-elm-app because it's usually done more harm than good in my experience. Feel free to copy it in to get that functionality back.
